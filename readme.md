# This is an old project and has been archived as of 6/27/2025.
Many modern executors already include built-in script managers that are significantly better than this one.
This app was created years ago and isn’t well-designed or maintained. I don’t recommend using it.
It remains available purely as a legacy project from my earlier work.
